## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

- 📝 To make testimonials grid section work on both desktop and mobile devices, I tackled the mobile view first, 👩‍💻 where testimonials were stacked one below the other, the classic way.
  Then, using a clever 🔍 'media query', I detected larger screens 🖥️ (like desktops and tablets) and transformed the testimonials into a cool 'grid display' layout, 📏 arranging them side by side.
  💻🔲 This way, the testimonials section looks fantastic on all devices! 📱💻🖥️ It was an awesome learning experience, and I'm excited to use these techniques in future projects! 🚀😄

### What I learned

During the completion of a frontend mentor challenge, I gained valuable knowledge in various aspects of web development. Firstly, I delved into the powerful world of CSS Grid, 📏 discovering how to create flexible and responsive layouts for my projects. Grids allowed me to organize elements in a visually appealing manner, enhancing the overall user experience. Secondly, I learned about CSS Isolation, which is a technique used to encapsulate styles within a specific container, preventing them from affecting elements outside of it. 🛡️ This is particularly useful when working on larger projects, as it helps maintain a clean and organized codebase. To implement CSS Isolation, I used the following code:

```css
.container {
  isolation: isolate;
}
```

Lastly, I explored the art of creating quotations on webpages, 🗨️ enriching the testimonials section with appropriately styled quotes. It was a delightful journey discovering how to present quotes elegantly, 🎨 adding personality and character to the testimonials and making them stand out to users. With these newfound skills in my toolkit, I'm eager to take on more exciting challenges and continue growing as a web developer. 🚀💻😊
